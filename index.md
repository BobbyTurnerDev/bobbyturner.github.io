## Hi, I'm Bobby Turner

A systems administrator currently working for Montgomery County in Dayton, OH.

In my free time, I like to learn new technology, try my hand at leathercraft, or play video games.

My current learning project is [a Discord bot to track Magic the Gathering trades and "trade binders"](https://github.com/FoldyHands/MagicTradingFloor), and I'm studying for my AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.
